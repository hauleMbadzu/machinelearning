However, some players may want to cheat their way to victory by using map hacks. Map hacks are programs or files that modify the game's memory or data to reveal hidden information, such as enemy positions, health, items, wards, spells, and more. This gives the user an unfair advantage over the other players who play by the rules.
 
One of the most notorious map hacks for Warcraft 3 Dota is called Warcraft 3 Dota Map Hack S. This map hack claims to be undetected by most anti-cheat systems, such as Garena Plus and Iccup.com. It also claims to support various versions of Warcraft 3 and Dota maps, such as 1.26a, 6.85k, 6.83d, and more.
